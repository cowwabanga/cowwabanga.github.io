<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>This is my first blog post for a very long time. Last time I wrote anything longer than 280 characters was in 2017, and I almost never use english language for writing.</p>
<p>There is a thing: I am from Russia, and I almost never studied english language, but was surrounded by it through web, games, music. So it just happens than at some moment of my life I've started understand it. However, since I do not study it and almost never use it for conversation, I am unsure about how good my skill is (and I know that speaking and writing are much harder for me than just listening).</p>
<p>I've tried to push myself to use social media like <a href="https://x.com/cowwabanga">twitter aka x</a> or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cowwabanga.bsky.social">bluesky</a>, but I do not like that this platform like bit loud bazaar, where I am should to yell to be heard. It's much better just speak, even it is with the void.</p>
<p>Some time ago I've read post <a href="https://andysblog.uk/why-blog-if-nobody-reads-it/">Why Blog If Nobody Reads It?</a>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a hidden value in blogging. There’s an old Zen saying: “Chop wood, carry water.” You do it not for the applause but because it needs doing.</p>
<p>Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.</p>
<p>When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.</p>
<p>So, who’s there real audience?</p>
<p>You’re not just writing for today’s invisible audience. You’re writing for:</p>
<p>Future you. Your posts become a time capsule of your evolving mind.
One right person. Maybe one day, someone stumbles across your words at exactly the right moment. And that changes something for them.
The work itself. Consistency beats virality. A hundred posts with depth will outlast a single viral hit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hits me - maybe I should stop using platform which limits you and force to consume content, and just start writing for myself?</p>
<p>So this is my main reason to start this website and blog.</p>
